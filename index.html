        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my GitHub page. As a software specialist, I sometimes
        tinker with a variety of technologies in areas that are unrelated to
        my core competencies. Some of it ends up on GitHub so you will find
        here the result of that tinkering. All code, including
        <a href="https://github.com/brunogirin/brunogirin.github.com">the HTML
        code for this web page</a>, is released under an open source license so
        feel free to copy, modify and fork anything you find on those pages.
        </p>

            <p>Prototype for Rewired State National Hack The Government Day, 2012</p>
            <p><abbr title="National Hack The Government 2012">NHTG12</abbr> was
            a lot of fun. This is my entry to the competition. It didn't win
            any prize but I enjoyed creating it and I learnt a thing or two
            in the process.</p></a></li>

            <h3>octave-fractals</h3>
            <p>Scripts to create Mandelbrot and Julia fractals in
            Octave</p>
            <p>I've always been fascinated by fractal geometry and the images
            of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. So after reading an article on the
            subject in Free Software Magazine, I decided to have a go at doing
            fractal images with Octave. In the process, I discovered quite a bit
            about fractals and here is the result of those experiments.</p></a></li>
